                                  the Vale as Kings in the North from their seat in Winterfell, recently retaken by the Starks from House Bolton. 
                                  It is by far one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight 
                                  thousand years. The head of the house is the Lord of Winterfell. Before the Targaryen conquest, the leaders of House 
                                  Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North. Jon Snow is the current King in the North and the Vale, 
                                  partially due to the allegiance of Petyr Baelish, the Lord Regent of the Vale, to House Stark. </p> </br>

                                  and House Bolton betrayed them, after joining alliance with House Lannister. Roose Bolton personally killed King Robb Stark. 
                                  Both the North and Winterfell were taken over by House Bolton, but their hold was jeopardized when Sansa Stark escaped their 
                                  clutches after learning that her brothers Bran and Rickon Stark were still alive. House Stark were restored to their former stature 
                                  after the Battle of the Bastards albeit at great cost with Rickon's death. Their success in this battle later leads to the resurgence 
                                  of House Stark as the royal family of the North, with its vassals declaring Jon Snow as King in the North. </p>

                                  <p><b>House Targaryen</b> is a former Great House of Westeros and was the ruling royal House of the Seven Kingdoms for three centuries, 
                                  before it was deposed during Robert's Rebellion and House Baratheon replaced it as the new royal House. The few surviving Targaryens fled into 
                                  exile. Currently based in Essos, House Targaryen seeks to retake the Seven Kingdoms from House Lannister, who formally replaced House Baratheon 
                                  as the royal House following the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor. </p> </br>
                                  <p>House Targaryen's sigil is a three-headed red dragon on a black background, and their words are "Fire and Blood". </p>

                                  <p><b>House Lannister </b>of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of Westeros, one of its richest and most powerful 
                                  families and oldest dynasties. It is also the current royal house of the Seven Kingdoms following the extinction of House 
                                  Baratheon of King's Landing. </p> </br>
                                  <p>Their lands are in the far west of the continent. Their seat is Casterly Rock, a massive rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset 
                                  Sea which has had habitations and fortifications built into it over the millennia. They are the Lords Paramount of the Westerlands and 
                                  Wardens of the West. As the new royal house, they also rule directly over the Crownlands from their seat of the Red Keep in King's Landing,
                                  the traditional seat of the royal family. House Lannister's Heraldry consists of a golden lion on a crimson background, and their House words 
                                  are "Hear me roar!", which is rarely mentioned. Their unofficial motto, which is as well known as the official one, is "A Lannister always pays 
                                  his debts" - which is used much more often and mostly in negative context, though it can also be used in the original, literal sense. </p>
